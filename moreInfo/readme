1. This project has a simple remote bean MessageManagerBean which has methods to add & receive message from topic.
2. AddAndReceiveMessageTest is used to invoke the MessageManagerBean remotely and calls methods to add message to topic and receive message from topic.
3. See server.log which captured a test run where "subscriber.receive(5000)"  received null message. I added comments to log with questions that did not make sense to me.(Search for '$$' to see my comments).
4. Also included my jboss configuration file(standalone-full.xml)
